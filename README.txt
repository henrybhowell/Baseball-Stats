CSC353 Final Project
Authors: Izzy Moody, Henry Howell, Dominic Flocco, Gabe Levy

This project implements a full-stack application that creates and maintains a working webpage
of season- and game-level baseball data. Data is scraped from various online sources, stores this data
into a local mySQL database, creates procedures to aggregate and query the data usefully, and implements
a front-end user interface for users to explore the database.

Data is scraped from baseball-reference.com and baseballsavant.mlb.com and reflects game and season level
statistics for pitchers and batters in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2015 through the 2021 season.

Here is a brief description of how the repository is organized, and how it can be executed:

data -> contains BSB reference data, savant data, stathead data, game results, and player info scraped from web
scraping -> includes 3 python data scrapers:
	scraperGames.py: scrapes game result data from baseball-reference.com
	scraperPlayerData.py: scrapes player info data from baseball-reference.com
	scraperGamelogs.py: scrapes game leve data for all players from baseball-reference.com
WebPage -> folder which contains:
	index.php -> homepage for main website
	assets -> folder which holds css style sheet, an image and 7 php pages
sql -> includes sql schema, functions and procedures
	8 sql procedures, 2 sql functions and 6 table schema

BaseballDataImporter.py -> imports scraped data into mySQL database (takes about 20 minutes to run)

index.php -> through running a localhost via PHP within the WebPage folder through the command "php -S localhost:3333"
	+ then navigate to the index.php file on the localhost
	+ assets/php -> contains each PHP handler page that runs each procedure from procedures.sql
